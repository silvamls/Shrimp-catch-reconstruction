# Shrimp-catch-reconstruction
R Code examples for shrimp catch reconstruction are available, accompanied by a spreadsheet file containing the reconstructed data.

Reconstructions were made using the catch data from government statistical bulletins. They were assisted by environmental variables such as sea surface temperature and rainfall. The fitted models were GLMs for all states. Further details about the conceptualization can be found at: https://doi.org/10.20950/1678-2305/bip.2023.49.e747
